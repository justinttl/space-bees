Describes administration steps to conduct play test consistently, including instructions spoken or presented to playtester, actions taken by experiment administrator, time limits for playtester, etc.
- Take notes on playtest date, time, team member, keyboard or controller, windows or mac, game version.
- If the tester finds a bug, record the bug, severity, location, and how it happened. Reset the tester to the beginning of the level and ask to avoid the bug. 
- **Remember not to be defensive. Take notes of feedback but don't comment or explain bugs.**
- "There is a 15 minute limit to the playtest time."
- "If you run into any issues. It's the game that's broken, not you."
- "While you're playing, please describe what they're doing aloud."
- After the playtest is complete:
	- "What were your initial impressions after the tutorial?"
	- "What were your impressions during level 1?"
	- "What were your impressions during level 2?"
- After the playtest is complete: "Rate the gameplay from low to high on a scale of 1-5 for the following:"
	- "Did the gameplay feel luck based?" (The goal is to establish a baseline and see if our design goals match the game outcome.)
	- "Did the gameplay feel skill based?"
	- "Does the gameplay feel like a mental challenge?"
	- "Does the gameplay feel like a physical challenge?"
	- "How clear was the objective at all times?"
	- "How fluid was the player movement?"
	- "How frustrating was the gameplay?"
	- "Were interesting choices provided to the player?"
	- "Do the character and controls feel real-time, continuous, and dynamic?"
	- "Does the camera movement feel smooth and intuitive?"
	- "Does the environment feel interactive?"
	- "Does the environment have variety?"
	- "How fair does the AI feel as an opponent?"
	- "How effective and believable are the AI decisions and animations?"
	- "How polished and cohesive does the game feel artistically?"
	- "How fun and engaging was the game?"
