# User Ratings
**user said "comparison was based on real games"**
- After the playtest is complete:
	- "What were your initial impressions after the tutorial?"
	I didn't know it was a tutorial. Updates felt slow and didn't update right away.
	- "What were your impressions during level 1?"
	What was the flower thing? Was it an enemy? Its the same color as the bees so you can't tell if its good or bad. The envoirment looked cool and was nice.
	- "What were your impressions during level 2?"
	It looked the same. COuldn't tell which type of bee. Was it going to shoot or chase? Where's the queen bee? Shouldn't there be a queen trapped in a cage.
