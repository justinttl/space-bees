# Notes
Could not navigate the menus with a controller
Started with the Tutorial from the Menu
Was originally confused with "WASD" or "Thumbstick" -> might need pictures?
Jumped intutively
"I don't know how to kick" -> "Button East" was unclear
Laughed at the Bee the first time
Just mashed at the bee to kill it
@ The start of Level_1, pressed North intuitively and rolled for the first time
Lots of jumping at the bees
Thought the flower was an enemy
"Am I Dying?"
Died and went to restart at the "Start Game" instead of "Start Tutorial"
On the second playthough tried to ignore the ranged bee
Camera is getting stuck on the higher platforms - was not part of the tutorial
Did not know they had to kill the bee -> Need some indication of the goals for the level
*Rolled Through the Door* -> This is a gamebreaking bug
Bees are too dark in the second level, did not see them
Got the ranged bee's timing down with dodging
Upset that they had to fully restart
"Kick is delayed"
"kick is funny"
Mad @ Ranged bee
"Need to be in a better position for the ranged bee"
defaults to kicks as main attack
"Just gonna be a rolly boi"
Fell off platform and thought it was unfair
-----------------------------------------------------
Needs background music
** No Story **, just "go kill bees"
Less Gravity? Was expecting more grand movement
Did not understand level structure -> for level 2 just felt like "You're here now"
Glitched through gate and end of game
Wish there was honey that slowed me down
What was the bee shooting?
Health Bar was not clear - did not know it was there
Would like a character select
Would like to be able to change the colors of the stripes
