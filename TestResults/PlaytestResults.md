## Describe and Justify Design Questions
The below questions were selected for open feedback for each level. The goal was to get their initial impressions once the game was completed before any influence from our questionaire. 

    - "What were your initial impressions after the tutorial?"
    - "What were your impressions during level 1?"
    - "What were your impressions during level 2?"

The goal of the initial questions was to establish a baseline and see if our design goals match the game outcome. Our assumption is that most players would find the game to be significantly more skill based and physically challenging. 

    - Q1: "Did the gameplay feel luck based?"
    - Q2: "Did the gameplay feel skill based?"
    - Q3: "Does the gameplay feel like a mental challenge?"
    - Q4: "Does the gameplay feel like a physical challenge?"

The goal of the second round of questions was to determine if all project goals are met or which areas need more focus.

    - Q5: "How clear was the objective at all times?"
    - Q6: "How fluid was the player movement?" 
    - Q7: "How frustrating was the gameplay?" 
    - Q8: "Were interesting choices provided to the player?" 
    - Q9: "Do the character and controls feel real-time, continuous, and dynamic?" 
    - Q10: "Does the camera movement feel smooth and intuitive?"
    - Q11: "Does the environment feel interactive?"
    - Q12: "Does the environment have variety?"
    - Q13: "How fair does the AI feel as an opponent?"
    - Q14: "How effective and believable are the AI decisions and animations?"
    - Q15: "How polished and cohesive does the game feel artistically?"
    - Q16: "How fun and engaging was the game?"

## Playtest Design Approach
Our approach to the playtest method was to be as neutral and observant as possible. Allow the player to load into the game with minimal instruction to simulate a real world player. The tutorial should guide the player through the major objectives, story, and controls without explaination from team members. The testers were given sufficient time to complete the full game experience. Any comments made by the testers were noted by the team member. If the tester became stuck or required assistance, the team member gave them a resolution without explaining the bug. After the test was completed, the team member asked the tester to answer the questionaire and provide feedback. 

## Playtest Visualization and Results
### Initial Impressions
Below is a summary of testers initial impressions per level:

#### Tutorial
Most testers understood and followed the tutorial step-by-step. A few items are missing that left the tester confused like story and camera controls.

#### Level 1
Most testers understood the objective and started killing bees. The range bee suprised users and was diffcult to dodge the range attack. A few testers had frustrating experience when jumping off the map resulted in death or bees could not be killed fast enough resulting in death. All testers were able to complete the level within the time limit. 

#### Level 2
Some testers were suprised by the size of the map and didn't like running to each bee just to kill it and run to the next.
