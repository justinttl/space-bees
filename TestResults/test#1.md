# User Ratings
- After the playtest is complete:
	- "What were your initial impressions after the tutorial?"
	The popups were in the way and boring. The player and bees are scary.
	- "What were your impressions during level 1?"
	The glowing rocks looks cool. All the lighting was nice but the bees look hidden.
	- "What were your impressions during level 2?"
	The map was so empty and just running around took too long. I felt too slow. Why are the bees just standing there?
