# Notes
What's thumbstick?
More confident with the keyboard and the mouse
Killed the bee almost instantly - "Scared me"
"I'm kinda scared"
punches the first bee - then moved to kicks
Jumps over the bees
"Unsure if I'm still in the tutorial"
Kicks the plant - no idea what it was
Tries to jump on the bees
Trying to jump to move faster
Does not like the loud ass footsteps
Jumped through the door and was like "woah"
"I'm speed running this"
Punching a lot of bees
Found roll by accident
Immidiately started using it and liked it a lot
Was not sure he was close to death
"I did not know I could die"
Restart -> Start naturally
"Oh I got to beat all these people again? Ok I'm ready"
kick is used more
"Kick kinda broken"
Jumped really high a couple of times right at the ledge
Kick feels about how it should - want to make sure I get them
"Oh I missed one - dammit"
Health bar needs to be lower and pointed out
Rolled through the final door and did not trigger credits
-----------------------------
It would be cool if there was a boss
Make the health bar more obvious
Make it clear you are leaving the tutorial
Maybe if it were more like Level 1 and Level 2 - communicate that
Does not know if the suspense adds to it
