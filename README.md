# 🚀 Space Bees 🐝

A silly 3D brawler we made in around 5 weeks to learn Unity game development.

Played around with

- Animation (Root Motion)
- Custom Assets (Blender)
- Lighting
- AI scripting and navigation (C#)
- Encounter/ Scene scripting (C#)
- Control mechanics and hit detection
- Sounds and eventing systems
